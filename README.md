# Fake Currency Detection System

A machine learning-based project for detecting counterfeit currency using image processing techniques implemented in Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview

This project implements a currency authentication system using machine learning and image processing techniques. The system analyzes currency images to determine whether they are genuine or counterfeit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - OpenCV (cv2)
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - (Additional libraries as used in your notebook)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-currency-detection.git
cd fake-currency-detection
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install jupyter opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open `Untitled.ipynb` in your browser
3. Follow the notebook cells to:
   - Load and preprocess currency images
   - Extract features
   - Train the model (if applicable)
   - Test with new images

## Dataset

The project includes sample images:
- `real note.png`, `Real.jpg`: Examples of genuine currency notes
- `fake.jpg`: Example of counterfeit currency note

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
